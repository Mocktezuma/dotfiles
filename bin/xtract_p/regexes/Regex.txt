# sample Regex file

# it is useful to store regexes in a file and access them repeatedly defining placeholders at runtime vice 
# constantly creating additional scripts to search on the regex of the day
# it is also useful to be able to perform greplike functions across multiple lines and with the full power of Perl

# the regexes are identified by index number eg 1.,2.,3., etc

# search for whatever you specify A= at runtime ("xtract . RGXP -f Regex -value A=foo").  Return the whole line.  The same as grep run against a simple string value

1. /\n.*?$A.*?\n/ 

# search for A on one line and B on the next: "xtract . RGXP -f Regex -num 2 -value A=foo B=bar".  Note the use of "-num" to specific #2 in the file (might change to switch to "-#" if that doesn't create parsing issues)

2. /$A\n$B/
